		Drylandsâ€™ defining feature of water scarcity puts them at disproportionate risk to all forms of
		land degradation. Africa, with ~75% of its surface area classified as dryland is thus
		particularly susceptible, due to land use, social and climate change. The human populations of
		the arid and hyper-arid zones are highly vulnerable because livelihoods here are marginal at
		best and the human-environment systems are tightly coupled and in non-equilibrium. Several
		observations suggest that the traditional grazing practices of pastoralist societies such as the
		Ovahimba and Damara, developed over centuries in response to the stochastic, non-equilibrium
		dynamics of arid rangelands with their frequent droughts, are changing. Such changes, in
		addition to expected climate change can only exacerbate soil degradation rates, and may
		constitute a regional tipping point. It may in fact constitute conditions for a multidomain,
		cascading regime shift to follow. Three main uncertainties prevent a confident assessment of the
		risk of a regime shift: 1) the extent to which the traditional Ovahimba grazing practices have
		changed, 2) the historical, recent and likely future rates of soil degradation and how these are
		related to grazing and restoration potential, and 3) the changes in climate and how these are
		likely to affect soil moisture levels and thus the potential for degradation and a shift in the
		boundaries of the arid zone. Exploring these uncertainties may lead to adaptation options, and
		will address a more comprehensive set of vulnerabilities and responses to a changing environment
		in the arid northwest of Namibia.
